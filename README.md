I'm a technical professional with a sharp mind.
Also a good team player you will find.

Enterprise JAVA, cloud is my game.
I like new challenges, no two the same.

I tend to work in docker and JAVA code. New things I try.
I'm interested in in-memory databases, and reactJS.

When the work day is over and done.
I cherish the progress and enjoy the fun.

My communication skills I'm told are good.
Will you remember this? I'll bet you would.
